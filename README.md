**Last Updated**: 2024
**Version**: 1.0.0

1. Create the environment with `python -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment for Python
   - If using Mac or Linux, type the command: `source env/bin/activate` 
   - If using Windows:
   - First, [set the Default Terminal Profile to CMD Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/profiles)
   - Then, type in the CMD terminal: `.\env\Scripts\activate.bat`
3. Make sure that your terminal is in the environment (`env`) not in the global Python installation
4. Install required packages `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
5. Check that everything is ok running `streamlit hello`
6. Stop the terminal by pressing **Ctrl+C**

### Execution

To run the dashboard execute the following command:

```
> streamlit run Dashboard.py
# If the command above fails, use:
> python -m streamlit run Dashboard.py
```


### Creating pre-trained models for the web dashboadr 

⚠️ **NOTE:** In the predictive analytics tab, the web dashboard is looking for a pre-trained model in the folder `assets/`. The first time that you execute the application, it will show an error saying that such file does not exist. Therefore, you need to execute the notebook inside the folder `jupyter-notebook/` to create the pre-trained model.

This logic resembles the expected pipeline, where the jupyter notebooks are used to iterate the data modeling part until a satisfactory trained model is created, and the streamlit scripts are only in charge of rendering the user-facing interface to generate the prediction for new data. In practice, the data science pipeline is completely independent from the web dashboard, and both are connected via the pre-trained model.
